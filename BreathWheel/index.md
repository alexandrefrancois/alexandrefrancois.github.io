BreathWheel is a soothing, sensory-driven experience that helps you master your breath.
Designed with minimalist elegance, it turns breathing into a focused, intentional act.

BreathWheel helps you take control of your breathing: press the wheel when inhaling, release and exhale.
The animated wheel expands and rotates as you breathe in, and contracts on the exhale.
Gentle vibration enhances focus during inhalation.

A counter in the top left corner tracks the number of seconds elapsed in the current cycle;
a counter in the top right corner indicates the number of cycles completed (tap to reset to 0).

No guides, no noise, just a tool that responds to you.

BreathWheel is ideal for mindfulness & breathwork practice, stress and anxiety relief, focus and grounding, sleep preparation, custom breathing rhythms.
