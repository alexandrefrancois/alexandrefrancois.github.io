The [Music on the Spiral Array . Real Time (MuSA.RT)](http://musa-rt.blogspot.com/) project started almost 20 years ago. My first collaboration with [Elaine Chew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Chew), MuSA_RT applies music analysis algorithms rooted in her [Spiral Array model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_array_model) of tonality, which also provides the 3D geometry for the interactive visualization space.

The MuSA.RT project lasted many years, produced numerous publications, and various versions of the system featured in lectures and performances all around the world.

The software produced for this project was a constantly evolving research prototype (not something to put in the hands of a general public user), and subject to contemporary technical limitations. A Mac App released in 2012, intended as companion software for the book [_Mathematical and Computational Modeling of Tonality: Theory and Applications_, Elaine Chew (2014)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461494744), made the system accessible to general users.

[MuSA_RT 2.0](/MuSA_RT) is a universal iOS/iPadOS/macOS app that analyses the audio signal from a microphone, and offers an experimental Augmented Reality experience on devices that support it, [available for download on the Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/musa-rt/id506866959) for your favorite device (and it's free).
