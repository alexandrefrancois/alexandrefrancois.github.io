## Research Interests

* Software architecture for interactive systems
* Dynamic models of perceptual and cognitive processes
* Design and creativity

### Software architecture

#### Software Architecture for Immersipresence (SAI)

SAI is a software architecture framework for the design, analysis and implementation of integrated media systems.

Publications: ComJnl 2011, NIME 2006, ETCV, IMSC-05-003, ICSE 2004, IMSC-03-001, MM 2000.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

#### MFSM

MFSM (Modular Flow scheduling Middleware) is an architectural middleware implementing the core elements of the SAI style. [mfsm.sourceforge.net]

Publications: ETCV.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

#### VisualSAI

VisualSAI is a graphical environment for visually creating and analysing component-based architectural designs in the SAI style. [visualsai.sourceforge.net]

Publications: IMSC-05-003.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

### Music computing

#### MIMI: Multi-modal Interaction for Musical Improvisation (with Elaine Chew and Dennis Thurmond)

MIMI is a multi-modal interactive musical improvisation system that explores the potential and powerful impact of visual feedback in performer-machine interaction.

Publications: IJART 2013, CIE 2011, IMIDA 2010, TPMC, NIME 2007, CS-07-889.

Funding: NSF

#### MuSA.RT: Music on the Spiral Array . Real-Time (with Elaine Chew)

MuSA.RT is a collaborative research project that integrates real-time music processing and content-based graphical rendering in interactive immersive environments.

Publications: ICMPC 2008, MCM 2007, CIE 2005, MM 2003.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC), NSF, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study

#### ESP: Expression Synthesis Project (with Elaine Chew)

The Expression Synthesis Project (ESP) explores the use of a driving interface for expression synthesis, also known as performance rendering. ESP aims to provide a compelling metaphor for expressive performance so as to make high-level expressive decisions accessible to non-experts.

Publications: AMC 2006, ACE 2006, NIME 2005.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC) and NSF

### Interactive systems

#### IMSC Communicator

The IMSC Communicator is an experimental extensible platform for remote, collaborative data sharing. The goal of this project is to explore and formalize architectural patterns for true multi-stream systems.

Publications: IMSC-03-001.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

#### The Virtual Mirror: A Handheld Mirror Simulation

The Virtual Mirror is a system simulating a handheld mirror.

Publications: ETCV, ICME 2003, IMSC-03-001, SIGGRAPH 2002.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC) and USC Arts Initiative

### Computer vision

#### Visual Sensing for Natural Human-Robot Interaction (with Gérard Medioni)

This project addresses the design and implementation of a computer vision system to empower personal robots with advanced vision capabilities.

Publications: ComJnl 2011, CVIU 2007, URAI 2006, CS-06-880.

Funding: ETRI

#### Video Event Markup Language (with Ram Nevatia)

The specification and development of a Video Event Markup Language (VEML) is part of a large scale effort supported by the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA) of the U.S. Government to promote video understanding at the event level.

Publication: MM 2005.

Funding: ARDA

#### Real-Time Video Analysis: Segmentation and Tracking (with Gérard Medioni)

This series of projects leverage color background model-based segmentation (change detection), and an original multi-resolution approach to tracking. Applications include background substitution (``blue-screen without a blue screen'') and player and ball tracking in racquet sports (tennis, racquetball).

Publications: ETCV, IRIS-04-422, IRIS-03-420, ICVS 2001, CISST 1999, Ph.D. Dissertation.

Invention disclosure: A System to Perform Real-time Video Stream Segmentation Using an Adaptive Statistical Background Model in HSV Color Space, Alexandre R.J. François and Gérard G. Medioni, file #2937, USC Office of Technology Licensing.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

#### 3-D Object Descriptions from a single image (with Gérard Medioni)

This series of projects combine vision and graphics in the design of interactive systems and algorithms for 3-D modeling from a single image. Projective properties of classes of Generalized Cylinders and bilateral-symmetric objects provide constraints that allow geometric reconstruction. Sparse and intuitive user input allows disambiguation and efficient computation.

Publications: IVC 2003 (ICPR 2002), IVC 2001 (ICMCS 1999), Ph.D. Dissertation.

Invention disclosure: A Human-assisted System to Build 3-D Models from a Single Image, Alexandre R.J. François and Gérard G. Medioni, file #2936, USC Office of Technology Licensing.

Funding: IMSC (NSF-ERC)

#### Shape/Object Recognition (with Gérard Medioni)

This project tackles the problem of generic shape recognition, in which exact models are not available. A Case-Based Reasoning approach performs learning of segmented, hierarchical shape descriptions, and recognition based on previous observation.

Publications: ICPR 2000, IWOR 1996, M.S. Thesis.

Funding: DARPA
