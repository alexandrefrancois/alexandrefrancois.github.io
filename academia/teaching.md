### Courses Created

#### Collaborative Development of Interactive Software Systems (Tufts University, Spring 2009)

This course addresses the collaborative design and implementation of interactive software systems. The course centers on a class-wide project, typically an interactive game. The lectures inform the project design and development process. Topics include design and human factors, project management, collaboration, software architecture, graphics, networking. The course emphasizes creativity, teamwork and hands-on experience.

The Spring 2009 class project was a finalist in the SIGGRAPH 2009 Research Challenge Competition.

#### Principles of Software Development - Games (University of Southern California, Spring 2007)

This special session of the last in a series of four undergraduate programming courses (101, 102, 105, 201) caters to students enrolled in, or interested in pursuing, the CS Games major. The course centers around the development and realization of a collaborative class project (a distributed interactive game). [Games Students Play, and Make]

#### Integrated Media Systems (University of Southern California, Fall 2002)

This seminar course covers the state-of-the-art technology for integrated media systems. The course focuses on the underlying architectures for media rich environments. Such environments integrate multiple modalities (aural, visual, haptic), perform extensive computations, synchronize, store, retrieve, and transmit multiple media streams seamlessly. Students study and present recent technical papers on integrated media systems and architectures. A collaborative class-wide project illustrates multimedia processing and application integration techniques.
