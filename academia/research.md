#### Real-Time Video Analysis: Segmentation and Tracking (with Gérard Medioni)

This series of projects leverage color background model-based segmentation (change detection), and an original multi-resolution approach to tracking. Applications include background substitution (``blue-screen without a blue screen'') and player and ball tracking in racquet sports (tennis, racquetball).

#### 3-D Object Descriptions from a single image (with Gérard Medioni)

This series of projects combine vision and graphics in the design of interactive systems and algorithms for 3-D modeling from a single image. Projective properties of classes of Generalized Cylinders and bilateral-symmetric objects provide constraints that allow geometric reconstruction. Sparse and intuitive user input allows disambiguation and efficient computation.

#### Shape/Object Recognition (with Gérard Medioni)

This project tackles the problem of generic shape recognition, in which exact models are not available. A Case-Based Reasoning approach performs learning of segmented, hierarchical shape descriptions, and recognition based on previous observation.
