Feeling stuck in a doomscrolling spiral? Meet Purr, your gentle escape from compulsive phone use.

Purr is a calming, minimalist experience designed to help you disconnect from overstimulation—especially when it's time to wind down. Instead of endless feeds and flashing screens, Purr offers a soft, tactile ritual that brings your attention back to the present.

A cute, animated cat greets you as the app begins. Stroke the screen with your finger and your phone responds with a gentle purr through sound and haptics, guiding you into a quieter state.

There are no likes, no alerts, no noise. Just you, your breath, and a quiet moment with a purring phone.

Whether you’re trying to fall asleep or take a digital detox, Purr offers a soft, sensory-driven transition away from the chaos of typical phone use.
