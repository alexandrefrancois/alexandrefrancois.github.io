## Introducing [Resonate](/Resonate)

I will be presenting my paper "Resonate: Efficient Low Latency Spectral Analysis of Audio Signals,"
at the [50th Anniversary of the International Computer Music Conference 2025](https://icmc2025.sites.northeastern.edu), June 8-14 in Boston, MA, USA.

In the meantime, check out the [Resonate Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVcB_ABiKC_cbemxXUUJXHAQsHEHxPOP1) and the [Oscillators app](https://alexandrefrancois.org/Oscillators/), which demonstrates real-time spectrograms and derived audio features.

## Published Apps

- [Oscillators](/Oscillators): Experiment with digital resonators.
- [MuSA_RT](/MuSA_RT): Experience a visual representation of tonal patterns - pitches, chords, key - in music as it is being performed.
- [Priorities](/Priorities): Simply manage lists of prioritized items.
- [Purr](/Purr): Soothe Your Screen Time. Mindful vibes. Cat included.
- [BreathWheel](/BreathWheel): Breathe. You're in control.

### Open Source Projects

- [Oscillators](https://github.com/alexandrefrancois/Oscillators): Digital oscillator models for signal synthesis and analysis, suitable for real-time audio processing.
- [noFFT](https://github.com/alexandrefrancois/noFFT): A reference implementation of the Resonate algorithm in C++ for Python.
- [WheelControl](https://github.com/alexandrefrancois/WheelControl): A SwiftUI wheel control with multiple speeds.
