<strong><a href="/Resonate">Resonate</a></strong> is a low latency, low memory footprint, and low computational cost algorithm to evaluate perceptually relevant spectral information from audio (and other) signals.

"[Resonate: Efficient Low Latency Spectral Analysis of Audio Signals](/assets/publications/FrancoisARJ-ICMC2025.pdf)" received the **Best Paper Award**
at the [50th Anniversary of the International Computer Music Conference 2025](https://icmc2025.sites.northeastern.edu), which took place June 8-14 in Boston, MA, USA.

I will give a late breaking demonstration of Resonate-based real-time, low latency audio features computation at the [First AES International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Audio (AIMLA 2025)](https://aes2.org/events-calendar/2025-aes-international-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-for-audio/), London, Sept. 8-10, 2025.

I will give a talk titled "Real-time, low latency and high temporal resolution spectrograms" on the implementation of Resonate and resonate-based spectrograms at the [Audio Developer Conference](https://audio.dev/conference/), Bristol, November 10-12.
