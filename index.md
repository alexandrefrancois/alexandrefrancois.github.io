#### Academic Bio

Alexandre R.J. François' research focuses on the modeling and design of interactive (software) systems, as an enabling step towards the understanding of perception and cognition.  His interdisciplinary [research projects](/academia/research) explore interactions within and across music, vision, visualization and video games. He was a [2007-2008 Fellow](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/people/alexandre-r-j-françois) of the [Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu), where he co-lead a music research cluster on Analytical Listening Through Interactive Visualization.

From 2004 to 2010, François was a Research Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu) in the [USC Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu). In 2010, he was a [Visiting Associate Professor](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~alex/) of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.hmc.edu) at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu). In 2008-2009, he was a [Visiting Assistant Professor]() in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs) at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu). From 2001 to 2004 he was a Research Associate with the [Integrated Media Systems Center](https://imsc.usc.edu) and with the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://sites.usc.edu/iris-cvlab/), both at USC.

François received the Diplôme d'Ingénieur from the [Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon](http://www2.agroparistech.fr) (France) in 1993, the Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies (M.S.) from the [University Paris IX - Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu) (France) in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from USC in 1997 and 2000 respectively.
